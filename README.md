MAZE GAME

1. Open three terminals.
2. Run command "make all".
3. In one of the terminals, run the command "./server" to start the server.
4. In the other two, run "./main" to start the games for player 1 and player 2 (viz-a-viz Pishach and Vetaal).
5. When the game ends, clean the output file by running "make clean"

In case sdl are not installed they need to be installed.
