What we have finish
1. Successfully created multiplayer (without networking) version of our game 
2. Created multiplayer with networking but some frames are getting skipped and some minor bugs. 
3. Movement of player is smooth in networking game but mechanics of fireball is little buggy.
4. Tried to display the current status of game in last moment of development but we didn't had even a *bit* of luck (sad corona days). In the end, it was buggy also.

What we were not able to accomplish but we wanted
1. Animation and sound
2. Some more obstacles
3. A bug-free playable game ;).

Future of this project if our IIT life permits ;(
1. Remove bugs.
2. After game is playable locally, take it to the internet
3. We want everyone to play it and be happy or sad or maybe no-one ;)
